# Anatomy-of-an-Outrage
Analyzing the Kathy Griffin/Trump story through the lens of Twitter.

This is my final project for Metis. In this project, I analyzed how Twitter reacted to the story of Kathy Griffin holding a mask that looked like Donald Trump bloody severed head.

I decided to look at this story because I wanted to look at a “case study” of  how people respond to a controversial story, and how a story goes viral.

To do this, I grabbed 2.1 million tweets using Tweepy, a python Twitter API wrapper. From there I separated the suspected bot tweets from the non-bot tweets, and then looked at the bot tweets, the first 100,000 tweets, and the rest of the tweets separately. 

From there I did topic modeling, looked at most retweeted links and hashtags used, and tried to label tweets based on political affiliation.

This repository contains my presentation, and Jupyter  notebooks in which I got, analyzed the tweets, and did topic modeling on them. A notebook with my plots from the presentation is coming soon.
